#Inter-process-communication-using-2-pipes#
Design a program using ordinary pipes in which one process sends a string message to a second process, and the second process reverses the   case of each character in the message and sends it back to the first process. For example, if the first process sends the message Hi There, the second process will return hI tHERE. This will require using two pipes, one for sending the original message from the first to the second process, and the other for sending the modified message from the second back to the first process
